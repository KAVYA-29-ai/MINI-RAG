Domain
NLP, Knowledge Systems, GenAI
 
1. Introduction
Organizations have massive internal knowledge scattered across documents, wikis, tickets, and emails. Search systems fail to provide reasoning-based answers.
 
2. Problem Statement
• Knowledge silos
• Poor enterprise search
• No contextual answers
 
3. Proposed Solution
Build a cloud-native RAG platform where:
• Enterprise data is indexed semantically
• Queries trigger retrieval + generation
• Answers cite internal sources
• Access control is enforced
 
4. Key Objectives
• Unlock organizational knowledge
• Improve productivity
• Maintain security
 
5. Key Features
• Semantic vector search
• RAG pipelines
• Role-based access
• GenAI explanations
 
6. End-to-End Product Flow
Data Ingestion → Vector Index → Query → RAG Answer → UI/API
 
7. Conclusion
This is a highly marketable enterprise AI product.
